It all started out with four of us, talking about how cool it would be to start a rockin’club. We felt that it wasn’t enough happening around here in Norway, so after a bit of to do or not to do, we finally decided to do it.

This was around may 1999.

We first asked the clubs around, if we could book the bands, and they get most of the income, but not one was interested, can you believe that?…

Since some of us was members of Moss Amcar cCub, we asked to borrow their club house, and that was ok.

We was now counting 10 members.We had our first party July 31st 1999.

It was our Swedish friends in Black Knights, who opened the ball, and it was so great that we had to continue.

In the same building as the amcar club, there was also a biker club, and since they had found another place for their club, we got their old place.

After a month of hard work of knocking’ down walls, building a stage, painting etc., it was finished and we re-opened in september with The Trouble Boys (ex. Teencats)

venue. Our intensions was from day one to do one gig each month, since the scene in Norway aren't good enough for weekly gigs. And so we did lots of hard work booking bands, getting PA for the gigs, picking up the bands on the airport, delivering them the next morning. As the only club up and running in the beginning and attracting people from most of southern Norway, we soon became a breeding place for new and old rockers in Norway. After a while the second Rock'n'Roll Club in Norway got back in action again booking bands. But we still keept on Rockin egar to be the best rockin' club in Norway.

Some new bands almost started their carear at our club like Rebels Revenge and Backyard Drifters, with support from all of our visitors vi also decided to have a go at Norways first Rockabilly Alldayer, and with the pre-party it reminded much about a festival. So the 3 next years we arranged a festival instead.

Thru the years we were in Kambo,Moss 82 different bands played at our club. Built For Speed(NOR) nine times, Rebels Revenge(NOR) eight times. Trouble Boys(NOR), Tempo Toppers(NOR), Twang Gang(NOR) all played five times. While Backyard Drifters(NOR), Darrel Higham played four times.

Anders Westhagen have enterd the stage the most times nine with Built For Speed, five with Trouble Boys one time as bass player backing Sandy Ford and in Nitrocats backing Tom Powder. He also appared once in Bulletproof and in "The wild bunch big band" all togeher 18 times.
